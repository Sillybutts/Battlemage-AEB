# THIS BLASTER IS SEMI-UNFINISHED. I figure its better to make what I have done so far public, and let people have at it, rather than it sitting around doing nothing.

## Description

Battlemage AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

## Firing Demo & other videos

First mechanism test (printed by Payton S.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIi_oPeBieA

Second mechanism test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqewE_DcPns

## DWELL TIME PROBLEM FIXES

Dwell time fixes:

TL:DR, the breech needs to stay closed longer.

In order to use either of these fixes, the total wheel movement back and forth will likely need to be increased.

Method 1: add a slot to the driving pin to delay movement.

<img src="GHimages/Battlemage%20AEB%209%20v19%20METHOD%201.png" width="500">

Method 2: Have the ram itself slide inside the ram-carrier. This uses a different 10-32 bolt than the standard setup https://www.mcmaster.com/92314A840/

<img src="GHimages/Battlemage%20AEB%209%20v19%20METHOD%202.png" width="500">

I personally think method 2 has more promise, but my method of keeping the ram from rotating out of position is semi-sketchy: using the head of a hex bolt in a hex shaped slot. Method 2 also needs a small edit before anyone prints it; the pin hole should be moved back so it doesn't hit the ram bolt head. The crank arm should also be reduced that same distance.

Neither of these have been printed or tested as of 7-20-2023.

## Other misc to-do stuff

- make top cover with no viewing slots as an optional bit
- straight down screws in the middle cover back, NOT ANGLED.
- storage slot for takedown pins during disassembly (like the Lynx)
- fix vertical travel of magazine so it catches in the magwell more reliably.
-  lock in nut on turnaround somehow
- keep the middle cover as two separate wings for easy assembly. Maybe add pegs between it and the top cover?
- more space for wires???
- fix switch hole spacing, print a bunch of testing bits.
- heat set screws to attach muzzle
- dovetail bottom rail front with the front of the front block so no screws are removed during disassembly and maintenance. Maybe same for the top rail, then cover with the muzzle?
- Make the middle slice of the crank cover less bendy by attaching it to the top cover better
- heat sets for screws on the catch block to aluminum bar connection
- add safety warning on file listing NOT FOR USE BY CHILDREN. Record video jamming a carrot into the breech, smashing it. No fingers allowed. 
- Remind me eventually to make a bolt disconnect for manual priming if need be

## Files

The only currently released files are F3D and STEP. This is MEANT to be both for people to edit them, and as a barrier of entry. Battlemage is an UNFINISHED, VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD BLASTER currently. It is only meant for EXPERIENCED BUILDERS AND DESIGNERS. It will NOT work first try.

## Print Info

Battlemage uses pretty much a whole 1kg PLA spool (if you were to print it all one color).

Infills:
All the functional parts (the catch, catch ramp, catch holder, plunger rod, plunger head, primingblock, crank wheel, turnaround) MUST BE PRINTED AT HIGH INFILL HIGH WALLS. I recommend 100% infill 5 walls.

Pretty much everything else can be printed at 20% infill 5 walls (and the very big parts can probably work with 10% 5 walls). 

Some parts have tight tolerances (mainly the dovetails in the catch area on the top cover print). Sanding and/or filing is recommended to make the dovetails go together smoothly.

## Hardware

The hardware can be found inside the F3D and STEP files. 

Other stuff: 

The blaster uses a 550 size motor: https://www.amazon.com/OGRC-Motor-Brushed-Traxxas-Slash/dp/B09TVVHC97/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1JHHTZKHYRXQM&keywords=550+motor&qid=1666213389&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjI5IiwicXNhIjoiNC45MiIsInFzcCI6IjMuOTEifQ%3D%3D&s=toys-and-games&sprefix=550+moto%2Ctoys-and-games%2C164&sr=1-5

Brushless 550 replacements are available online, the blaster could relatively easily be converted for those.

Currently used gearbox: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800966945183.html I use a 100:1 ratio. 8mm shaft option.

## Assembly

There is no assembly guide due to the extremely experimental nature of Battlemage so far. Please look at the F3D or STEP file in cad software to see how its assembled.
