## Description

Cynthia is a bolt action blaster using the same basic layout as the Indra by CaptainSlug. Cynthia began with me figuring out how to fix all the issues with the Indra, but I pretty quickly realized it would be easier to design a whole new blaster from the ground up, rather than fix the Indra part by part.
Cynthia contains no original Indra parts.


## DWELL TIME

Dwell time fixes:

TL:DR, the breech needs to stay closed longer.

In order to use either of these fixes, the total wheel movement back and forth will likely need to be increased.

Method 1: add a slot to the driving pin to delay movement.

Method 2: Have the ram itself slide inside the ram-carrier. This uses a different 10-32 bolt than the standard setup https://www.mcmaster.com/92314A840/

<img src="GHimages/Battlemage%20AEB%209%20v19%20METHOD%202.png" width="500">

I personally think method 2 has more promise, but my method of keeping the ram from rotating out of position is semi-sketchy: using the head of a hex bolt in a hex shaped slot. 

Neither of these have been printed or tested as of 7-20-2023.

## Print Info

Cynthia uses less than one 1kg PLA spool (if you were to print it all one color).

Infills:
- Black: 
- - PlungerRod, PlungerCap, 100% Gyroid, 5+ walls.
- - ThumbholeStock needs a brim.
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 

- Orange: 
- - BoltBase, BoltHandle, FrontGripKeeper, Catch, CatchPusher, PlungerHead, 100% infill, 5 walls.
- - BoltHandle, FrontGripKeeper, CatchPusher need brims.
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 

- Green: 
- - MagwellBack, Magwell_L, Magwell_R, Grip_L, Grip_R, 100% infill, 5 walls.
- - All the tall green parts benefit from a brim.
- - To be safe, I recommend you print each tall part one at a time.
- - Everything else, 20% Gyroid, 5 walls. 

Some parts have tight tolerances (mainly the dovetails in the catch area on the top cover print). Sanding and/or filing is recommended to make the dovetails go together smoothly. The top cover part can be broken if you try and force the dovetails together.
